Vat calculation
How to calculate New Vat Amount and New Value excl Vat
A = Vat Amount
B = Value excl Vat
C = Selling price of combination product = 9.50
D = Total price of individual products = 11.45
New Vat Amount = A * C / D
New Value excl Vat = B * C / D
For example,  for “Six Bites”
New Vat Amount = 0.88 * 9.50/11.45 = 0.73
New Value excl Vat = 4.42 * 9.50/11.45 = 3.67
Vat amount for combination product “Sharing Platter”  = £1.50  (E)
